- Github Repository: <http://github.com/bauhouse/symposium-workspace>

There's a quick and dirty description of what this project is about and some guidelines as to how the contributors can help implement their work.

## Overview

This is a project born out of the Symposium 2010 workshop and it is a project that will constantly evolve. The project's primary goal is to create a space where we can share the experience the attendees of the meetup with the rest of the Symphony community.

## Features

These are some features that would be great for the project (Allen's Note: most of these may not mean anything to people outside of the event)

* Fazal's awesome idea of horizontal paneling of the attendees' presentation. Verticality + Horizontality(?) == #win. It's fact, folks.
* [nice to have] Componentise each of the sections with a respective utility so that we showcase Symphony 3's ability to "plug and play"; i.e. drop a section with their respective DS/view/utility and they'll get a more-or-less working image gallery.
* Overall aesthetics of the site should be governed by Johanna. Others are more than welcome to put forward suggestions/improvements to Johanna.
* Use all the latest! We want to preach what we do: HTML5, CSS3, SVG, etc, etc.
* More. Contributors, please feel free to add.
